Demo user/admin app build v0.5

This is a demo applicaiton to demonstrate my development skills through the iterative process, this should give an in-depth overview of my logic and thought processes, as well as the execution of them.

From a practical standpoint the aim was to demonstrate competency in the usage of UI/UX responsive design, HTML5, CSS3, Sass Preprocessing, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax API calls, State management, File upload, NPM build tools and libraries, task runners (Gulp), source control (Git) and app deployment via Heroku.  Testing is an ongoing process, so if you find any bugs please raise them as an issue so they may be resolved, Thanks.
